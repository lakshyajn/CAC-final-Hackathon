# Network Intrusion System

Hey everyone, I have trained model for network intrusion system that is differentiating between good and bad connections
It differentiates between 2 types of connections-> normal (normal) and neptune (dos)
I have the jupyter notebook file and the predicted data
Predicted Data is in binary format i.e, normal is considered as 0 and neptune is considered as 1. 

I got a score of 95.30 after submission on AI-Planet

I guess this is good, and I'll try to improve it furthur :)
